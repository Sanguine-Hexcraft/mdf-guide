# Maryland Deathfest XXXX Guide

A terminal-based guide for **Maryland Deathfest 2026**, built as a learning project as well as something useful.

This project exists primarily to:
- learn modern Python project structure
- practice working with real-world data
- build a useful personal tool
- stay terminal-focused and minimal (black metal treatment)

It is *not* intended to be a production app or an official/unofficial festival resource.
